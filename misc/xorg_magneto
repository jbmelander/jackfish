# Manually created xorg.conf for use with Psychtoolbox VR HMD drivers
# for the Oculus Rift and similar devices. This needs to be tailored
# to your specific setups. The given example is for a Oculus Rift CV1,
# connected to the HDMI output of a AMD RavenRidge integrated graphics
# chip on a AMD Ryzen 5 2400G processor, running under Linux 5.13
# with Ubuntu 20.04.2-LTS.
#
# "amdgpu" needs to be replaced by a suitable name of the display
# driver for your graphics card, unless it is indeed a modern AMD
# gpu.
#
# "DisplayPort-1" needs to be replaced by the name of the video output
# of your desktop monitor on X-Screen 0.
#
# "HDMI-A-0" needs to be replaced by the name of the video output to
# which your VR HMD is connected.
#
# You would need to copy this file to /etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/ and then
# logout and login again into a X11 native desktop session, ie. no Wayland!
